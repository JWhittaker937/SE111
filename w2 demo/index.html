                <p>I am Jared Whittaker. I have worked in warehouses for 10ish years.<br>
                    I have been an avid computer gamer for most of my life and enjoy coding on the side.<br>
                    I am familiar with some of the basics of <b>HTML</b> but have never touched Javascript.<br>
                    My goal is to complete this program as quickly as possible while staying on the <u>Deans list</u>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Come on, you apes! You wanta live forever?<br>
                                 —Unknown platoon sergeant, 1918<br>

                        I always get the shakes before a drop. I’ve had the injections, of course, and hypnotic preparation,<br> and it stands to reason that I can’t really be afraid.
                        The ship’s psychiatrist has checked my brain waves<br> and asked me silly questions while I was asleep 
                        and he tells me that it isn’t fear, it isn’t anything important—it’s<br> just like the trembling of an eager race horse in the starting gate.
