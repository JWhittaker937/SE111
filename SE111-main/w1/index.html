    <p>I am Jared Whittaker. I have worked in warehouses for 10ish years.
        I have been an avid computer gamer for most of my life and enjoy coding on the side.
        I am familiar with some of the basics of HTML but have never touched Javascript.
        My goal is to complete this program as quickly as possible while staying on the deans list.
