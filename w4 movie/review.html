        <hr>   
        <p>A young man growing up on earth finds his purpose on a whim when he decides to become a citizen.<br>
        In one of <b>Robert A. Heinlein's</b> most controversial books our young man Jaun Rico joins the military<br>
        as a member of the Terran Mobile Infantry. During his time in training he learns valuable skills as well as <br>
        helping him to become a strong and confident man. This sense of belonging and of personal strength resonates<br>
        with many men of all ages. While the story has been criticized and the government in the movie labeled as a <br>
        tyrannical fascist state the well thought out nature of the source material creates a wonderful parody.<br>
        <br>
        The movie has become a cult classic with memes and references abound since its release. While I would much<br>
        prefer the book to the film they both serve a purpose of introducing the wild world of the not so distant future.<br>
        The special effects are awful. The writing layered on top of the book is cringe worthy and the blatant disregard for<br>
        sanity is hard to ignore. If however the viewer can forgo reality it can be a rather joyfilled film to get wasted to.</p>
        <h3> Triva</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nudity was removed in several versions of the movie.</li>
            <li>The movie was intended to be satirical propaganda however it was not received as such by the public. </li>
            <li>The US box office only grossed 54.7 Million</li></ul>
